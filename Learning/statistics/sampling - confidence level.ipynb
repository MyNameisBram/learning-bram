    "Understanding sample size is important in hypothesis testing. \n",

    "Test procedure, called `two-portion z-test`, is appropriate when the following conditions are met: \n",
    "- the sampling method for each population is simple random sampling\n",
    "- the samples are independent\n",
    "- each sample includes at least 10 successes and 10 failures\n",
    "- each population is at least 20 times as big as its sample\n",

    "This approach consists of four steps: \n",
